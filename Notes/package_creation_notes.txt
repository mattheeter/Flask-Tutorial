Turning solution into a package should fix any import issues that we run into by having application run modularly
1. Need to create __init__.py file in folder of same name as app ("app" in this case)
2. Add templates folder, static folder, form.py and models.py to <app_name> folder
3. Add from imports to database instantiation from app.py to __init__.py
4. Add from User and Post imports to right above "if __name__ == "__main__":" to routes.py file, also in app folder
5. Renaming app.py to run.py, as it will just be used for running app
6. Add "from app import app" to run.py
7. Remove all imports from "flask" from __init__.py except for "Flask" and add to routes.py
8. Do the same with forms import, except cut and paste everything
9. All custom modules need "app." in front of their names when imported
10. Need "from app import app" in routes
11. Need "from app import routes" at END of __init__.py
Now need to run run.py
